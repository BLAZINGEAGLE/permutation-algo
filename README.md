# permutation-algo
A simple C++ program to obtain all permutations of an n-length string.
Permutation algorithms are known to be notoriously time-intensive(some may run in the order of O((n!)^2), which is unacceptably slow for large values of n). I present an algorithm that uses only O(n(n!)) time. Sans the fact() function, the time complexity is O(n!), which is about the fastest you can get.
